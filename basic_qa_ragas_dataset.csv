What regulations and mechanisms does Singapore have in place to protect migrant workers?,"Singapore has regulations and mechanisms in place to protect migrant workers. These include:

1. Mandatory orientation for employers of migrant domestic workers: Singapore has implemented mandatory orientation programs for employers of migrant domestic workers. This helps to educate employers about their responsibilities and the rights of the workers.

2. Settling-in programs for migrant workers: Singapore provides settling-in programs, also known as post-arrival orientation, for migrant workers. These programs aim to help workers adjust to their new environment and understand their rights and responsibilities.

3. Workplace safety regulations: Employers in Singapore are required to purchase medical insurance for their workers. The country has made significant progress in workplace safety, resulting in a decrease of 75% in the workplace fatal injury rate from 2004 to 2018. Singapore ranked 7th best in workplace safety in the OECD in 2018.

4. Access to recourse and assistance channels: The Singapore government facilitates migrant workers' access to recourse and assistance channels by providing 24-hour hotlines. This allows workers to seek help and report any grievances they may have.

5. Protection against passport withholding: Employers in Singapore are prohibited from withholding workers' passports. This ensures that workers have control over their own identification documents.

It is important to note that while Singapore has implemented these regulations and mechanisms, there are still some areas where laws and public opinion may not be entirely in favor of migrant workers. For example, migrant domestic workers are excluded from Singapore's main labor law, resulting in unregulated working hours. Additionally, Singapore does not have a minimum wage, and pregnant women migrant workers may be deported if found to be pregnant.","['1   Brief\nSingapore has 1,427,500 migrant workers, comprising \n38 per cent of its labour force (MOM 2019a).

What are the specific challenges faced by migrant domestic workers in Singapore?,"The specific challenges faced by migrant domestic workers in Singapore include:

1. Exclusion from main labor laws: Migrant domestic workers are excluded from Singapore's main labor law, which means they do not have the same protections and regulations as other workers. This results in unregulated working hours and potentially exploitative working conditions.

2. Lack of minimum wage: Singapore does not have a minimum wage, which can leave migrant domestic workers vulnerable to low wages and unfair compensation.

3. Deportation if found pregnant: Women migrant workers in Singapore can be deported if they are found to be pregnant. This policy can lead to fear and discrimination against pregnant migrant workers.

4. Restriction of movement: Singaporean employers often restrict the movement of domestic workers, which can result in isolation and limited ability to seek help or support when needed.

5. Limited access to recourse and assistance: While there are 24-hour hotlines available for migrant workers with valid grievances, accessing recourse and assistance can still be challenging. Some migrant workers may struggle to access services due to perceptions around their respectability or victim blaming.

Overall, these challenges contribute to the vulnerability and potential exploitation of migrant domestic workers in Singapore.","['workers’ access to recourse and assistance channels by  \nproviding 24-hour hotlines.

How can public attitudes towards migrant workers in Singapore be improved?,"Public attitudes towards migrant workers in Singapore can be improved through the following measures:

1. Raise awareness among the general public: Design campaigns and initiatives that provide accurate and positive information about migrant workers and their contributions to the national economy. This can help dispel misconceptions and stereotypes.

2. Ensure access to rights and freedoms: Ensure that women and men migrant workers are able to fully access their rights and freedoms in line with international labor and human rights standards. This includes providing equal access to services, social security, schools, and healthcare facilities.

3. Promote social inclusion: Avoid separating migrant workers' accommodation through city planning. Physical distance can create barriers to social interaction and integration. By promoting inclusive city planning, migrant workers can have better opportunities for social engagement and community interaction.

4. Facilitate meaningful interaction: Design policies and platforms that facilitate meaningful interaction between migrant workers and the public. This can include community events, workshops, or initiatives that encourage dialogue and understanding between different groups.

5. Address discrimination and barriers: Stimulate attitude changes on specific issues to tackle discrimination and barriers that prevent the fair treatment of migrant workers, especially women. Adopt policies, regulations, and operating procedures that support social inclusion and address violence and abuses.

It is important to note that these recommendations are based on a 2019 study on public attitudes towards migrant workers in Singapore. Implementing these measures can help promote a more inclusive and supportive environment for migrant workers in the country.","['9\n XRecommendations   Brief  \nPublic attitudes towards migrant workers in Singapore\n1.

What targeted interventions can be implemented to complement and reinforce public campaigns about migrant workers and their contribution to the national economy?,"Some targeted interventions that can be implemented to complement and reinforce public campaigns about migrant workers and their contribution to the national economy include:

1. Engaging influencer groups: Target interventions towards influential groups such as schools and news media to promote positive behavior towards migrant workers and their families. This can be done through educational programs and awareness campaigns.

2. Conducting awareness-raising activities: Design campaigns to raise awareness among the general public about the accurate and positive information regarding migrant workers and their contributions to the national economy. This can help to shift social norms and shared values.

3. Promoting accurate information: Provide accurate information about migrant workers and their contributions to the national economy through information campaigns. Focus on specific sectors and problems to personalize the messages and make them relatable to the public.

4. Addressing negative attitudes: Develop campaigns that address the root causes of negative attitudes towards migrant workers. This can involve challenging stereotypes and promoting understanding and empathy.

5. Avoiding victimization: Take care to ensure that messaging does not portray migrant workers, especially women migrant workers, as victims or inherently vulnerable. This can undermine their claims to the same rights at work as nationals.

6. Promoting inclusion and solidarity: Encourage organizations and communities to promote solidarity and inclusion by accepting and supporting migrant workers as members. This can help to combat discrimination and social exclusion.

It is important to note that these interventions should be implemented in partnership with governments, international organizations, and other relevant actors to maximize their impact.","['accurate and positive information about migrant \nworkers and their contribution to the national \neconomy.\nComplement and reinforce public campaigns with \ntargeted interventions directed at “influencer” groups \nsuch as schools and news media.

What were the main findings related to public attitudes towards women migrant workers in Singapore?,"The main findings related to public attitudes towards women migrant workers in Singapore are as follows:

1. Positive attitudes towards migrant workers have declined since 2010.
2. People who know and engage with migrant workers on a personal level are more likely to be supportive of migrants and have a positive attitude towards them.
3. Polarization in views has increased, and people with limited or no interaction with migrant workers are less supportive than before.
4. Positive attitudes of Singaporean respondents who employ domestic workers have also decreased, despite their frequent interaction with migrant workers.
5. The surveyed Singaporean public strongly supports stronger law enforcement to reduce violence against migrant women (77%) and supports migrant women having access to shelters if they experience violence (79%).

These findings highlight the need to address negative attitudes and promote better support and protection for women migrant workers in Singapore.","['2\nSuch attitudes can also detrimentally affect policies on \nlabour migration, including those most affecting women \nmigrant workers, such as policy on domestic work. \nIn order to understand the overall level of public support \ntowards migrant workers, the Safe and Fair (ILO and UN \nWomen) and TRIANGLE in ASEAN (ILO) programmes \nconducted a four-country study of public attitudes in \nJapan, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.
