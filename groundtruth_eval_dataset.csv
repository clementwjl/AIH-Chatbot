What regulations and mechanisms does Singapore have in place to protect migrant workers?,"1   Brief
Singapore has 1,427,500 migrant workers, comprising 
38 per cent of its labour force (MOM 2019a). To meet the 
needs of sectors such as domestic work, building and 
infrastructure construction, as well as ship repair and 
construction (Bal 2017), the country has relatively open 
admission policies for migrant workers. 
Singapore has in place regulations and mechanisms to 
protect migrant workers and has innovated mandatory 
orientation for employers of migrant domestic workers 
and settling-in programmes (post-arrival orientation) 
for migrant workers. It has made significant progress in 
workplace safety, with employers required to buy medical 
insurance. The workplace fatal injury rate has decreased 
by 75 per cent over 2004 to 2018, and Singapore ranked 
7th best in this regard in the OECD in 2018 (MOM 
2019b). The Singapore Government facilitates migrant 
workers’ access to recourse and assistance channels by  
providing 24-hour hotlines.

What are the specific challenges faced by migrant domestic workers in Singapore?,"workers’ access to recourse and assistance channels by  
providing 24-hour hotlines. Migrant workers with valid 
grievances are allowed to find another employer, and 
employers are prohibited from withholding workers’ 
passports. However, laws and public opinion are not all in 
migrant workers’ favour. Migrant domestic workers are 
excluded from Singapore’s main labour law, resulting in 
unregulated working hours. Singapore does not have a 
minimum wage; women migrant workers are deported 
if found pregnant; and Singaporean employers often 
restrict movement of domestic workers, resulting in 
isolation and restricted ability to seek help when needed. 
This research has shown that despite the demand for 
“low-skilled” workers in Singapore and other countries 
of destination, significant proportions of the public have 
negative perceptions of migrant workers, attitudes 
in  contradiction to the actual contribution made to 
destination economies and societies. Unfortunately,","Migrant domestic workers in Singapore face challenges such as exclusion from labor laws, unregulated working hours, lack of a minimum wage, deportation if found pregnant, restrictions on movement by employers, isolation, and limited ability to seek help."

What were the main findings related to public attitudes towards women migrant workers in Singapore?,"2

labour migration, including those most affecting women 
migrant workers, such as policy on domestic work.

towards migrant workers, the Safe and Fair (ILO and UN 
Women) and TRIANGLE in ASEAN (ILO) programmes 
conducted a four-country study of public attitudes in 
Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. The full report

main findings related to Singapore. 
The study explores public attitudes related to labour 
market shortages, migration and crime, social and 
cultural threats, equal treatment with nationals, 
and violence against women migrant workers. The

domestic work sector. In total, 1,005 members of the  
Singaporean public aged 18–65 years were surveyed,","The main findings related to public attitudes towards women migrant workers in Singapore were explored in a four-country study conducted by the Safe and Fair (ILO and UN Women) and TRIANGLE in ASEAN (ILO) programmes.
